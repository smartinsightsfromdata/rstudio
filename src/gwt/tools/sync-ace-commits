#!/bin/sh

# This script is used to automate combining an upstream version of Ace
# with the patches that we maintain.
#
# If you need to run this script, some prerequisites are required.
# - Install Node.js and npm
# - Run "sudo npm install --global dryice"
#
# To sync to a more recent upstream commit of Ace, update the "git checkout"
# line below with the SHA-1 of the upstream commit. (Do NOT use a branch, for
# example "upstream/master"; use the SHA-1 as it's the only thing guaranteed
# never to change.) Then run this script.
#
# As upstream Ace evolves, inevitably they introduce changes that conflict
# with the patches we maintain. To resolve these conflicts, go to the ./ace
# subdirectory that this script creates, and:
# - `git remote set-url origin git@github.com:rstudio/ace.git`
#                               # Only need to do set-url once
# - `git checkout <SHA-1>`      # Go to the upstream commit
# - `git merge <bugfix-branch>` # Try merging
# - If previous step SUCCEEDS, start at the top but try the next branch.
# - If the merge FAILS:
# - `git merge --abort`
# - `git checkout -b <new-bugfix-branch>` # I use the old name plus a number
# - `git merge <bugfix-branch>`
# - Resolve the merge conflict as you usually would, and commit
# - `git push -u origin <new-bugfix-branch>`
# - Update this sync-ace-commits script to refer to the new bugfix branch
# - Repeat all of these steps if you still get merge conflicts

# NOTE: 'vim-commands' API merged upstream; should be unneeded with next Ace update
# NOTE: 'no-core-commands' and 'vim-page-commands' should be unnecessary with next Ace update
# NOTE: 'dont-warn-on-scroll' likely needs to be re-thought as
#   Ace will (may?) be gaining new defaults in next release re: scroll behaviour
